            <h3>Places to eat</h3>
            <p>We definitely like to eat and lucky for you Eugene has some real treasures when it comes to food. Like a good burger? Got it covered. Like vegan options. Oh boy, you've come to the right place. Like organic locally grown ingredients. You might not want to leave after stopping by.</p>
