                his: "I was born in Michigan, but lived in Asia (the Philippines) and Europe (Moldova) during my childhood. My family moved back to the U.S. for good when I was in the 5th grade. I attended the University of Arkansas (Go Hogs!) and received my B.S. in Computer Science in 2008. I worked for four years and then decided I wanted to further my education. I applied to four grad schools, with the University of Oregon being the last one. After visiting the UO, I fell in love with the area and really felt like I belonged in the Northwest. After spending all my saved money on a 30 day trip across the Middle East, Europe, and Northern Africa with my groomsman Chris, I packed up all my belongings and drove a moving truck 2,000+ miles from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Eugene, Oregon in August 2012. I had my first date with Megan two days before my grad school classes would begin. I graduated with my M.S. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Oregon (Go Ducks!) in 2014 and have been working in Eugene as a Web Developer since. Because of my unique childhood, I have always had a passion for traveling. I also love triathlons, hiking, skiing, movies, and photography.",
                hers: "I was born and raised in Beaverton, Oregon. My Mom was a teacher, so we would spend the summers at our family cabin at the Hood Canal in Washington.  Where some families would camp or go to Disneyland, our family would get up at 4am, drive three hours to Mt. Bachelor, and ski all day.  I was raised to love the outdoors, appreciate good food, be creative, and follow my passions. I went to Washington State University.  You could say it runs in the family: my parents met at Wazzu, my aunt Lisa and uncle Craig met at Wazzu, and my Aunt Janet and cousin Lauren went to Wazzu.  Go Cougs! I wasn’t as sure about my future career as Jordan was - but it all worked out in the end.  I got my Masters in Education and today I work as an Academic Advisor at the University of Oregon."

                his: "We met on Match. She winked at me and then I replied with an email so I guess she made the first move. She only had four photos of herself and about four sentences on her profile. None of her photos were close ups of her face so I was a little hesitant at first. She did have a jumping picture though (which I later found out was only added because she saw I had jumping photos) and mentioned she was on the ski team in high school. I wrote the email and the rest is history.",
                hers: "I moved to Eugene to work at the University of Oregon. It was a big move for me - my first job out of graduate school, and I didn't know a single person in town.  After a few months, and some encouragement from my girlfriends, I decided to try Match.  Reading Jordan’s profile, I was a bit intimated - he competes in triathlons, travels the world, hikes, etc.  I was too nervous to message him, so I decided to send him a “wink.” Thank goodness he responded! Turns out, he likes some boring activities too - except he almost lost me when he asked if I've ever committed a felony.  Apparently that's breaking the ice to Jordan.  I dated two Jordan’s from Match - “Jordan 1” and “Jordan 2.”  Poor “Jordan 2” - I found myself mixing up details on our dates, and confusing him with “Jordan 1.”  I just couldn’t get over the sweet, freckled, goofy “Jordan 1.”  As we like to say, it was love at first wink."

                title: "First Date",
                his: "We decided to meet up for lunch at a Thai restaurant for our first date. It was the Saturday before my grad school classes would begin at the UO. The first thing I remember is walking in and giving her a hug. We sat down and started to talk and had to ask the waitress to come back three times because we couldn't talk and decide on what to order at the same time. We were the only ones in the restaurant during our entire meal, which at the time seemed strange. As we walked outside and were about to leave our separate ways, I noticed that she was driving a Volkswagen Passat. I made a stupid comment about how I drive a Volkswagen too and I was way too excited about it. Immediately, I thought I blew any chance I might have had of seeing her again. Thankfully, she texted me back later that night and we made plans for our second date the following week.",
                hers: "Let’s set the scene -  It was a warm, sunny afternoon in September.  I walk into what was described to me as a “highly rated thai restaurant,” looked around, and noticed that nobody was in the entire restaurant.  Everyone wants an uncomfortably quiet first date spot right?  Then, we have to read through an ~8 page menu and try to order something that we can both share.  Thankfully, we survived the first date.  It ended with Jordan exclaiming, “hey! we both drive VW’s!”"

                title: "Proposal",
                his: "I had everything planned perfectly. Our third date was at the Lone Pine Farms pumpkin patch back in October 2012 (totally my idea, by the way). We've gone back every year since. Megan always dresses up real cute when we go and I always bring my camera. I knew that I had the perfect plan to propose and capture that moment forever. As I'm pushing the wheelbarrow toward the pumpkin patch, all I can see are the tons of people picking out pumpkins. I had forgotten how many people went there for pumpkins!! I was beginning to lose hope that I would have any sort of privacy for the big moment. When we finally arrive, Megan starts looking for the perfect pumpkin immediately while I'm solely focused on scouting the area to find a quiet, secluded spot to pop the question. I finally find \"the spot\" and I know right away that this is where I want to propose to her. A row of sunflowers on both sides created a private little clearing that opened up to the field. I called her over, set my camera down, took a few test photos, then took Megan's hand, and got down on one knee. I had been practicing what I was going to say the previous night. I felt prepared but I'm pretty sure the first words out of my mouth were, \"So...ummm...\". I quickly recovered and said everything I had planned on saying. I was a little emotional, as was she, as I took out the ring and put it on her finger. I will never forget how surprised she was and how she kept saying, \"Are you serious? Are you serious??\" over and over again. I had completely forgotten to take a picture while I was on my knee, which is hilarious considering how extensive my plan was to capture that exact moment. Megan didn't remember anything I said for the first half of the proposal, which is also funny. It was completely \"us\". Right after I proposed, a bunch of people showed up in that area but for those five minutes we had the whole place to ourselves.",
                hers: "Our third date was to Lone Pine Farms Pumpkin Patch, so every year we go back to celebrate our anniversary. You would think that after three years together I might have suspected a proposal that day, but no. We woke up and decided it was a nice day to go get our pumpkins. I showered, only because we usually take pictures - thank goodness!  We found the perfect spot to take some photos, and after a few, Jordan got down on one knee, and I was completely surprised. I kept repeating “really!?” Half way through I realized that I didn't hear a thing he said because I was so surprised! Of course I said yes.  We were on cloud nine, roaming the pumpkin patch, hardly able to pick out our pumpkins. It was so sweet, simple, and us. "
